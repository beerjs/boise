BeerJS Boise
=========

BeerJS Boise is a welcoming get-together for everyone who wants to learn about JavaScript, advanced and beginners alike.

Beer.js is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.

We want to socialize, have fun, and talk shop.

Please note, BeerJS Boise happens at a bar and will require valid photo identification (Drivers License, Passport, etc) to enter.  Don't forget yours!
